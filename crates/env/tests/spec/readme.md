# WebAssembly Spec Tests

This document provides an overview of how spec tests are implemented and utilized in this project. The goal is to ensure that HAL conforms to both the official WebAssembly specification and any additional WebAssembly proposals that are implemented. The incubator serves as a playground for development based on original specifications, and these tests will likely be maintained as well.

## Overview

The WebAssembly specification tests are a critical component of this project. They are designed to validate that HAL adheres to the WebAssembly standard, as well as any new proposals that have been integrated. These tests ensure that our implementation is both compliant and robust.

### Key Objectives

1. **Ensure Conformance with WebAssembly Specification:**
    - The spec tests make sure that HAL conforms to the official WebAssembly specification. This includes verifying that all instructions, modules, and behaviors adhere to the standard as defined by the WebAssembly community.

2. **Ensure Conformance with WebAssembly Proposals:**
    - Beyond the core WebAssembly specification, HAL also supports various WebAssembly proposals. The spec tests are used to validate that the implementation of these proposals is correct and behaves as expected.

3. **Incubator as Development Playground:**
    - The incubator is a dedicated environment where new features and proposals are developed and tested. It serves as a playground for experimentation and early development based on the original WebAssembly specs.
    - Spec tests in the incubator are maintained to ensure that any developments align with the original specifications and that they can eventually be integrated into the mainline project.
